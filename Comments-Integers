Good work on the integer array tools!

The four new methods all work well.

One thing: your javadoc comments aren't always clear or 100% accurate.  
For instance, your comment on the getMinIndex method says "Find the min of the index"
  But what is the index?  And what would its min be?
  Actually, what that method does is finds the index of the smallest item in the array.
  Your comments should be clear about details like that.
  
Overall, however, this is some very good work - some of your best so far this year!

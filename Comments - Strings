String Array Tools -

This is a very good start so far.  There are some unfinished pieces here.  Clean those up and re-post, please!

(1) In main(), you call the sumArray() method.  But you have (correcly) commented out that method.  You should 
also comment out the call to it in main().
(2) Your getMax() and getMin() methods work well.  But getMaxIndex() and getMinIndex() return the largest 
and smallest items, not their locations. Please fix that.  I can work with you if you need it, or ask a friend.

Your code actually doesn't compile because of issue #1.  And when it does, it gives incorrect results because of issue #2.

Fix these and you'll be in good shape.
